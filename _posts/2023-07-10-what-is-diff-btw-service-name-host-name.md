In the context of computer networking, a service name and a host name refer to different concepts:

Service Name: A service name is a label or identifier used to identify a specific network service or application running on a computer or a network device. Examples of service names include "HTTP" for web services, "SMTP" for email services, "FTP" for file transfer services, and "SSH" for secure shell services. Service names are typically assigned and recognized by standard protocols such as the Internet Protocol suite (TCP/IP). They help in establishing communication between different applications or services running on different hosts.

Host Name: A host name, on the other hand, is a label or identifier assigned to a computer or a network device on a network. It is used to uniquely identify a specific device among other devices in a network. Host names are often human-readable and can be associated with an IP address. For example, "www.example.com" is a host name that represents a specific web server, and "mail.example.com" represents a specific email server. Host names are used to address and access specific devices over a network, allowing users or applications to connect to the desired device or service.

To summarize, a service name identifies a specific network service or application, while a host name identifies a specific computer or network device on a network.
