- WireMock is an HTTP mock server. 
  - can be primed to serve canned responses to particular requests(stubbing)
  - captures incoming requests so that they can be checked later(verification).
  - record/playback of interactions with other APIs, injection of faults and delays, simulation of stateful behaviour.

# Setup

## Writing a test with JUnit 4.x

- To use WireMockâ€™s fluent API add the following import:

```java
import static com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.client.WireMock.*;
```
