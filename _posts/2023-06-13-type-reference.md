## TypeReference

In Java, `TypeReference` is often used in scenarios where generic type information needs to be captured at runtime. Since Java's type erasure removes generic type information at compile time, `TypeReference` provides a workaround to retain that information.

When working with serialization frameworks like JSON or XML parsers, generic type information may be needed to correctly deserialize objects. By using `TypeReference`, the framework can capture the generic type at runtime and deserialize the object accordingly. This is particularly useful when dealing with generic collections or complex data structures.

Reflection allows Java programs to inspect and manipulate classes, methods, and fields at runtime. In some cases, when using reflection to access generic types, `TypeReference` can be used to provide the necessary type information. It helps in obtaining the generic type at runtime and performing operations based on that information.

Java's type inference sometimes struggles with inferring generic types, especially in complex scenarios. By using `TypeReference`, you can explicitly specify the generic type when calling a method or creating an object, helping the compiler infer the correct type information.

By using `TypeReference`, you can overcome the limitations imposed by Java's type erasure and work with generic type information at runtime. It allows you to retain the necessary type information and perform operations specific to the generic type, even though the type parameters are erased during compilation.

## Java's type erasure

Java's type erasure is a process in which generic type information is removed ("erased") at compile time. It is a feature of the Java programming language that ensures compatibility with older versions of Java and allows generics to interoperate with pre-existing non-generic code.

When using generics in Java, such as defining generic classes, interfaces, or methods, the type information specified within angle brackets (<>) is used by the compiler for type checking and compile-time safety. However, this type information is not preserved at runtime due to type erasure.

During the compilation process, the compiler replaces generic type parameters with their upper bounds (or Object if no bounds are specified). This process is known as type erasure. It ensures that compiled generic code is compatible with non-generic code, as erased generic types are essentially treated as their raw types.

For example, consider the following generic class:
```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T item;

    public void setItem(T item) {
        this.item = item;
    }

    public T getItem() {
        return item;
    }
}

```

After compilation, the generic type parameter T is erased, and the class becomes equivalent to the following raw type:

```java
public class Box {
    private Object item;

    public void setItem(Object item) {
        this.item = item;
    }

    public Object getItem() {
        return item;
    }
}
```

This means that at runtime, there is no specific information about the generic type T available within instances of the Box class. Consequently, the compiler performs necessary type checks during compilation, but the generic type information is not accessible at runtime.

It's important to note that type erasure applies only to generic types, not to generic methods. Generic methods retain their type information at runtime.

Although type erasure simplifies the Java language and allows for backward compatibility, it also imposes limitations, such as the inability to perform certain runtime type checks or create arrays of generic types. Workarounds and additional techniques, like reflection and bounded type tokens, are often employed to overcome these limitations.
